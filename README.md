This is a website for a school project

Planning:
I planned the document to have a scrolling design with clear and defined sections detailing different things. Such as an about me and methods of contact.

I wanted to make it mininalist using dark and easily readable colours. Also only using a small navbar at the top to quickly jump to specific sections.

I decided to put a small picture of myself in the top right so that people who come to my website can see who I am. I chose to also put my name as a large title at the top to show that it is my page. The sections are ordered in a way that means that people can see the most important sections first without having to scroll.
