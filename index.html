        <h2 id = "about">About me:</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Danny, and I'm a passionate enthusiast with a diverse range of interests. By day, you can find me scaling the heights of both virtual and real-world challenges. I have a deep love for playing the electric guitar, immersing myself in the melodies and rhythms. When I'm not strumming away, I'm tearing up the trails on my mountain bike or embarking on thrilling rock climbing adventures.

            But I'm not just an outdoor adventurer and musician. I'm also a tech aficionado with a keen interest in cybersecurity. My spare time often finds me diving into the digital realm, researching and learning about the intricacies of online security. I'm fascinated by the ever-evolving landscape of technology and the importance of safeguarding it.
            
            When I'm not immersed in tech or outdoor pursuits, I thrive on the camaraderie of gaming with friends, exploring virtual worlds together. And when the screens turn off, I cherish quality time with my family, where board games bring us closer, creating lasting memories and loads of laughter.
            
            Life is an adventure, and I'm here to embrace it all, from the joy of playing the guitar to the thrill of outdoor exploration, the fascination of tech and cybersecurity, and the warmth of family bonds.</p>
